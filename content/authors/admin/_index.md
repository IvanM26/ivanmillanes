I'm a data scientist passionate about the delivery of predictive analytics and statistical models. I currently craft solutions that rely on Natural Language Processing, Optical Character Recognition, and other predictive Machine Learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests, to name a few) to address operational challenges across industries including Insurance, Financial Services, and the Public Sector.
